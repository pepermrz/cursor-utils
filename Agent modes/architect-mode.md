# Architect Mode

Architect Mode is a specialized agent mode designed to assist in high-level software architecture design and decision-making. This mode helps in creating robust, scalable, and maintainable software architectures while considering various technical and business requirements.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Architecture Design
- System component identification
- Component relationship mapping
- Interface design
- Data flow modeling
- Technology stack recommendations

### 2. Design Pattern Implementation
- Pattern recognition and suggestion
- Best practices guidance
- Anti-pattern identification
- Implementation strategies

### 3. System Analysis
- Performance evaluation
- Scalability assessment
- Security analysis
- Reliability planning
- Maintainability considerations

### 4. Documentation
- Architecture diagrams
- Technical specifications
- Design decisions
- System constraints
- Integration guidelines

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Architect Mode
- Starting new projects
- Major system redesigns
- Technology stack decisions
- Integration planning
- Performance optimization
- Scalability planning

### Best Practices
1. Consider business requirements
2. Plan for scalability
3. Design for maintainability
4. Document decisions
5. Review and iterate
